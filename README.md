# Data Analysis and Visualization

This project demonstrates *data cleaning, filtering, and visualization* using *Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib* in a Jupyter Notebook.

---

## 📘 Project Overview
The notebook includes:
- Data Cleaning (handling missing values, removing duplicates)
- Data Filtering (based on specific conditions)
- Data Visualization (creating graphs using Matplotlib)

This helps to understand how raw data can be transformed and visualized effectively.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📊 Output Example
The notebook generates various types of visualizations such as:
- Bar Graphs  
- Line Charts  
- Scatter Plots  

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository  
2. Open the .ipynb file in *Jupyter Notebook* or *Google Colab*  
3. Run all the cells to see data analysis and graphs
